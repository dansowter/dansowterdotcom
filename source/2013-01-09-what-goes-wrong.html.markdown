#What goes wrong

##Jessica Livingston
##Partner, Y Combinator

[Slides](http://startupschool.org/2012/livingston/)

### Determination
- Resilience (resists backwards)
- Drive (pushes forward)

### Rejection (why you need resilience)
- Speaks about AirBnB
- Started as a website for people to rent out airbeds for conferences.
- Eating badly, maxed out CCs before arriving at YC.
- Set goals, measured everything
- **New ideas usually seem crazy at first**
- Spoke about how hard it is to fund a hardware company
- Y Combinator had similar problems for the same reasons as other startups
- **If you execute well, eventually you'll win people over.**

### Variety of problems
- Building a food ordering app? Founder took a waiter job
- Started with phonecalls to banks to avoid age discrimination

### Cofounder disputer
- People underestimate the value of co-founder relationships
- Do you know them well
- Have you worked with them
- Did you go to school with them?
- Red flags don't go away
- Do they work hard enough, are they competent

### Investor Monster
- Herd mentality
- I'd be interested once you get some more traction
- Fund-raising is hard and slow until it's fast and easy
- They keep delaying
- You've got to create some kind of competitive situation

**Fundraising's a bitch. Doesn't count until the money's in the bank.**

### Distractions
- Write code
- Talk to users
- Exercise

### Make something people want.
- Build stuff and talk to users.
- Fundraising is a necessary distraction, but try not to spend too much time on it.
- HR Acquisitions (Corporate dev people) are uniquely demoralizing

### If you don't make something people want
- This is the biggest cause of failure
- Being brilliant and determined is not enough
- Starting out with a reasonably good idea isn't enough -- it must evolve.

### Rollercoaster
- No damping you'd have in a larger company
- Don't get immobilized by sadness.
- Things are never as bad or as good as they seem.

**This is hard, not impossible**
