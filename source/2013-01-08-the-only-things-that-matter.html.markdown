### People are the only thing that matters.
- Founder of Github.
- Called himself the 'Janitor' -- went around fixing things.
- Titles are bullshit. Too much to do for anyone to specialize
- When you get bigger and specialize - do you have the right mix?
- Tom is the logical one
- Chris is the visionary one
- PJ is the business / operations one
- Scott guards the culture.
- Decisions need to be in the middle, checking and balancing one another.
- How can each person push the company forward.
- Companies don't do things. People do.

### Product is the only thing that matters.
- Everything you add dilutes the entire product.
- Focus over features.
- You need a designer. Someone who will make it something people want.
- Your company needs a mission. One sentence.
- Choose something small in the beginning that you can actually solve.
- Don't worry about entering a market. Almost every product in the world is terrible.


### Philosophy is the only things that matters.
- Never set out to create a specific culture
- At some point you might like to codify this culture to make it easier to explain.
- Optimizing for happiness - Customers, Team and Shareholder
- Best argument wins - it's the argument, not the person delivering it. No politics
- Work from first principles.
- Create superfans. Buy developers beer.
- Be awesome and change the world.
- A strong culture is the best way of attracting talent.
